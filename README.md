# audiozoa.github.io

## Overview

We created this for a collaborative environment. As of now, the
repository [audiozoa/uns](https://github.com/audiozoa/uns) contains
publicly available audio tracks - for use of remixing, mixing, edit,
and generally creating unique versions of the songs.

We have created these tracks, and have posted our own versions on this
Github Page. Feel free to let us know about any of your mixes and we
can feature them on this site!

## Formatting

The general format of the records will follow a convention of:

`<song name>-<meta data>-v<id number>.<release number>.<version number>`

You can use the meta data as a way to delineate instruments, style, etc. For the
id this will represent your id version of the song. Release will reference
your release version and the version number will act as your increment in a release.
